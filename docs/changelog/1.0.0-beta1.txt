This is a bit unusual! Two things led to this:

- FoamFix has recently (0.10.11) started covering not just optimizations, but bugfixes (missing ghost chunkloading patches),
- BBoldt's Unabridged pack had to remove BugfixMod due to crashes related to block breaking.

In essence, FoamFix for 1.7.10 is currently a combination of the ghost chunk loading patches and an updated, bugfixed and improved version of williewillus's old BugfixMod. I hope you'll enjoy it!
